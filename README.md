# 🎮 CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains all the projects I've completed as part of the 
**CS50 Artificial Intelligence (AI)** course by Harvard University. 
The course is part of the **CS50** series, and it covers various AI topics, 
including search algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks.

## Projects List
### 1️⃣ **Project 1: [Degrees]**
   - **Description**: The project is based on the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game, where we attempt to connect two actors through movies. For example, if we are given two actors,
   - the program will find the shortest path of movies that connect them. Each path is represented by a sequence of movies where two actors starred together.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Search problem
   - **Code**: [Project 1 Folder Link](./degrees)

### 2️⃣ **Project 2: [TicTacToe]**
   - **Description**: This is a TicTacToe game against the implemented AI. This project search for the optimal move by considering every scenario after each move. Please try but you'll NEVER win 😁
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Search problem
   - **Code**: [Project 2 Folder Link](./tictactoe)

### 3️⃣ **Project 3: [Minesweeper]**
   - **Description**: This is a Minesweeper game. The goal is to know where all the bombs are ubicated. You can either play by yourself or ask the AI to make a move.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Knowledge problem
   - **Code**: [Project 3 Folder Link](./minesweeper)

### 3️⃣ **Project 4: [Knights or Knaves]**
   - **Description**: The AI of this project must determing weather a player is a knight(always say the thuth) or a knave (always lies) by the sentences they say.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Knowledge problem
   - **Code**: [Project 4 Folder Link](./knights)

### 3️⃣ **Project 5: [PageRank]**
   - **Description**: This is a Ai that determines the ponderate relation between diferent elements. This system is used is web seraches such as Google.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Bayesian Network problem
   - **Code**: [Project 4 Folder Link](./pagerank)

### 3️⃣ **Project 6: [Heredity]**
   - **Description**: This is a Ai that determines weather a genetic trait is passed to a child by it's parents and the probabilty of it.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Bayesian Network problem
   - **Code**: [Project 4 Folder Link](./heredity)

## 💻 About the Course

The **CS50 AI** course provides an introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications. It teaches foundational AI 
concepts through hands-on projects, including search algorithms, optimization, machine learning, and neural networks. 
The course offers a comprehensive overview of how AI can be applied in real-world scenarios.
