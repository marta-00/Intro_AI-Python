# üéÆ CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains all the projects I've completed as part of the 
**CS50 Artificial Intelligence (AI)** course by Harvard University. 
The course is part of the **CS50** series, and it covers various AI topics, 
including search algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks.

## Projects List
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Project 1: [Degrees]**
   - **Description**: The project is based on the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game, where we attempt to connect two actors through movies. For example, if we are given two actors,
   - the program will find the shortest path of movies that connect them. Each path is represented by a sequence of movies where two actors starred together.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Search problem
   - **Code**: [Project 1 Folder Link](./degrees)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Project 2: [Tic Tac Toe]**
   - **Description**: This is a TicTacToe game against the implemented AI. This project search for the optimal move by considering every scenario after each move. Please try but you'll NEVER win üòÅ
   - **Technologies Used**: Python
   - **AI Skill**: Search problem
   - **Code**: [Project 2 Folder Link](./tictactoe)
